- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- ðŸ§¬ Iâ€™m aiming for a PhD in Molecular and Translational Biology.
- ðŸ§ª My current research project focus on understanding the structure and physiological changes of hemeproteins when exposed to hydrogen sulfide, specially the binding and release of it. This can be use to test the slow release of hydrogen sulfide in human stomach fibroblast cells to assess the toxic concentration.
